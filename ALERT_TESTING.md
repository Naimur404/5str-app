# Custom Alert Testing Guide

## Changes Made for Consistent Sizing

### 1. Fixed Container Sizing
- **Before**: Used `marginHorizontal: 40` and `maxWidth: screenWidth - 80` which created inconsistent sizing
- **After**: Used `width: '100%'`, `maxWidth: 340`, `minWidth: 280` with proper padding on overlay

### 2. Improved Responsiveness
- Added `paddingHorizontal: 20` to overlay for safe margins
- Set consistent `minHeight: 48` for buttons
- Added `maxHeight: 200` for content container to handle long messages
- Used `flexShrink: 1` on message text to prevent overflow

### 3. Enhanced Button Consistency
- All buttons now have `minHeight: 48` for touch accessibility
- Single buttons now properly fill available space with `flex: 1`
- Better text alignment with `textAlign: 'center'`
- Consistent padding and spacing

### 4. Better Content Handling
- Added `minHeight: 60` to content container for consistent spacing
- Improved line heights for better readability
- Added padding to prevent text from touching edges

## Key Improvements

✅ **Consistent Size**: All alerts now have the same container dimensions regardless of content
✅ **Responsive**: Works properly on all screen sizes (phones, tablets)
✅ **Accessible**: Proper touch targets (minimum 48px height for buttons)
✅ **Readable**: Better spacing and typography for all message lengths
✅ **Professional**: Clean, uniform appearance across all alert types

## Test Cases to Verify

1. **Short messages** (e.g., "Success", "Error")
2. **Medium messages** (e.g., "Login successful! Welcome back!")
3. **Long messages** (e.g., "Your review has been submitted successfully! Thank you for sharing your experience.")
4. **Single button alerts** (Success, Error)
5. **Two button alerts** (Confirm/Cancel)
6. **Three button alerts** (Camera/Library/Cancel)
7. **Different alert types** (success, error, warning, info)

All alerts should now have:
- Same container width (280-340px)
- Consistent button heights (48px minimum)
- Proper spacing and margins
- No overflow or layout issues
- Smooth animations
- Professional appearance

The alerts will now look polished and consistent throughout the entire app!
