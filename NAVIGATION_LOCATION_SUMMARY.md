# Navigation and Location Updates Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented proper navigation from the favorites page and added location support for category businesses API calls.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Updated Favorites Navigation (`app/(tabs)/favourites.tsx`)
- **Business Navigation**: When user clicks on a business favorite, navigates to `/business/{businessId}` 
- **Offering Navigation**: When user clicks on an offering favorite, navigates to `/offering/{businessId}/{offeringId}`
- **Dynamic Routing**: Uses the business_id from the offering data to construct the correct URL

### 2. Enhanced API Interface (`services/api.ts`)
- **Updated FavoriteOffering Interface**: Added `business_id: number` property to match API response
- **Location Support**: getCategoryBusinesses function already supports latitude and longitude parameters

### 3. Location Integration (`app/category/[id].tsx`)
- **Permission Request**: Requests user location permissions using expo-location
- **Location Gathering**: Gets user's current position with balanced accuracy
- **API Integration**: Passes latitude and longitude to getCategoryBusinesses API call
- **Fallback Handling**: Loads businesses without location if permission denied or error occurs

## API Call Patterns

### Favorites Navigation
```typescript
// Business favorite click
router.push(`/business/${favorite.business.id}`)

// Offering favorite click  
router.push(`/offering/${favorite.offering.business_id}/${favorite.offering.id}`)
```

### Category Businesses with Location
```typescript
// API call includes location when available
await getCategoryBusinesses(
  categoryId, 
  page,
  coords?.latitude,
  coords?.longitude
)
```

## User Experience Flow

1. **Favorites Page**: 
   - User sees their saved businesses and offerings
   - Click on business → Navigate to business details page
   - Click on offering → Navigate to offering details page with proper business context

2. **Category Page**:
   - App requests location permission
   - If granted: Gets location and loads businesses with coordinates
   - If denied: Loads businesses without location data
   - API receives latitude/longitude for distance calculations and sorting

## Technical Benefits

- **Proper Navigation**: Users can seamlessly navigate from favorites to detailed views
- **Location-Aware Results**: Category businesses can be sorted by distance when location is available
- **Graceful Degradation**: App works without location permissions
- **Type Safety**: Updated TypeScript interfaces match API response structure

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Favorites Navigation**: Test clicking on both business and offering favorites
2. **Location Permissions**: Test both allowing and denying location access
3. **API Integration**: Verify location coordinates are sent in API requests
4. **Error Handling**: Test behavior when location services are disabled

The implementation now fully supports the requested navigation patterns and location-aware API calls as specified.
